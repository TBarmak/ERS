Objective: Acquire all of the cards in the deck.

    The entire deck is dealt out evenly to the players. The players are not allowed to look at their cards. The game starts with the user dealing
a card face up to the "slap pile". The players will alternate dealing cards face up until somebody puts down a face card or an Ace (FoA).
    When a FoA is played, the next player must play another FoA. The player will deal cards until they have run out of chances or they have
played another FoA. If the next player does not play a FoA in the number of chances they are given, the pile goes to the person who played
the FoA. The number of chances to play a FoA is determined by the value of the FoA played. If a Jack is played, the next player has 1 chance
to play a FoA. J = 1, Q = 2, K = 3, A = 4. If a player successfully plays a FoA in their number of chances, the next player is then required to play
a FoA. This continues until somebody fails to play a FoA in their number of chances, in which case the pile will go to the player who played
the most recent face card.

WINNER STARTS THE NEXT ROUND OF PLAY.

    The real fun begins with slap rules, which override the face card rules. If a player slaps the pile first in a slappable situation, they will
receive the pile. The pile can always be slapped in the case of a "double" (when the same value is played twice in a row) or a "sandwich"
(when the same value is played separated by one other card). Other versions of the game include "marriage" (when a king is played on top
of a queen, or vice versa) or "divorce" (marriage separated by one card). To include these slapping conditions, check the corresponding
boxes before clicking "Start Game". If a player slaps when these conditions are not met, they must "burn" a card by dealing one of their
cards to the bottom of the slap pile. The slapping speed of the computer can be set using the difficultly slider before clicking start game.
