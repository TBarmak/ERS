Hi, I am a twitter bot that plays chess! @ me in a tweet followed by your move in PGN notation without move numbers
with #startgame to start a game. For example, "@queencaptures e4 #startgame". If you would like to play a game as
black, start with the tweet "@queencaptures #startgame" and I'll make the first move :) I will reply with my move in PGN
notation. From then on you only have to reply with your move. Make sure to not include @queencaptures in direct replies
to my tweets, I'll interpret it as being tagged twice and get confused :( I'll let you know if I'm having trouble
understanding your moves. Each user can only be playing one game at a time. If you already have a game going with me,
tweeting #startgame will erase your progress from the previous game and start a new one. Good luck!

Useful hashtags:
#resign - you might have to use this one a lot ;)
#possiblemoves - I'll reply with a list of possible moves in the position
#getpgn - I'll reply with the move history of the current game in pgn notation
#error - will help my creator make sure I'm functioning properly
